1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a way to write javascript within HTML. One syntax difference is that to call a class you just write class but in JSX you have to write className because class is a already a used property inside javascript. 

Researched answer: JSX is a markdown syntax extension that is similar to HTML. Also one syntax difference is that instead of using HTML's class you will have to use className to modify an element because class is already a protected word in javascript.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: I  do not know the answer to this question because I was in the hospital and missed the props lecture.

Researched answer: Okay, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. And state is used to hold data within a component. I think I get it. Like smart components and dumb components **(I was told we don't use this naming convention anymore also) 
but you would use props to store data in a main component and then pass that data down to a child component so that child component can do a specific job. 

4. What is the DOM?

Your answer: I don't remember the technical term for the DOM but it is what we see on a browser. All the different buttons and event listeners, h1, headers, body tags and so forth are put on to the DOM.

Researched answer: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It allows programs to change document structure, style and content. The DOM uses the document as nodes and objects so that different languages can interact with the page.
